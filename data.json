Growing up in a building with kids who would rarely let him bat, Joel D?Souza stuck to looking out the window for most of his childhood. Swinging on a swing was his favourite sport as it required little energy and zero friends. He would spend most of his time trying to do nothing and yet look busy only because he was busy daydreaming and lost in his thoughts. And if history has taught us anything, childhood trauma plus a pondering mind make for a great career in stand-up comedy. And Joel had started early, winning every open-mic competition and emerging as the most promising new face in the city. With Comicstaan 2, he won the hearts of the judges and the audience with his sharp and witty punchlines. So it became a win-win situation in the end, really. At present he has  65k+ subscribers and more than 4,110,539 views on his youtube channel.",
